Intended platform for final project: Cross-platform - Android, iOS
Intended framework/programming language for your final project: React Native
Whether you want to explore cross-platform development: Yes

Explanation:
I have chosen React Native as the framework for my final project because it allows me to develop cross-platform mobile applications for both Android and iOS using a single codebase. This significantly reduces development time and effort compared to building separate native apps for each platform. React Native leverages JavaScript and React are widely used technologies with a large community and extensive ecosystem of libraries and tools. By opting for cross-platform development, I aim to reach a broader audience and maximize code reuse without compromising on performance or user experience.
